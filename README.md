# Interview-Questions

Remember interview questions are just a way to check your level or preparations for your upcoming job interviews. They are not meant for actual preparation.

Therefore,

1. Keep studying and build your concepts from basic to advance levels.
2. Keep writing code to improve your skills. Apply the concepts you have learned in your projects.
3. Keep sharing what you have learned or acheived.
